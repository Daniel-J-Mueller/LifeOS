# AGENT Guidelines

These guidelines apply to all contributions in this repository.

* Always consult `PLAN.md` to determine the next task. The task closest to the top without a check mark is considered **next up**.
* When a task from `PLAN.md` is completed, add a new task in a reasonable location to keep the plan moving forward.
* Keep `PLAN.md` as a bulleted list with GitHub style checkboxes.
* Add documentation or tests whenever applicable. If any automated tests exist, run them before committing.

LifeOS Architecture Overview
============================

LifeOS is organized into modular components to simplify development and testing. Responsibilities for each subsystem are explained in `subsystem_responsibilities.txt`.

- **Bootloader**: Initializes hardware state and loads the kernel.
- **Kernel**: Core services such as memory management, task scheduling and device management. See `kernel/overview.txt` for details.
- **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)**: Provides a consistent interface to underlying hardware. Documentation resides in `hal/overview.txt`.
- **Device Drivers**: Implement support for specific peripherals.
- **Compute Inventory Service**: Gathers hardware details early in boot.
- **Console Interface**: Minimal text interface for user interaction.
- **External Intelligence Hooks**: Integration points for advanced frameworks.

Each component will be developed incrementally with clear responsibilities and interfaces.

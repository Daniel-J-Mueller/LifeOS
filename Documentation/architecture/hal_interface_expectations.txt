HAL Interface Expectations
=========================

The Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) standardizes interactions with low-level devices so that the kernel and drivers remain portable. Key expectations include:

- **Initialization hooks**: A set of routines must be provided to configure timers, interrupts, and essential bus controllers before other subsystems start.
- **Uniform access methods**: HAL functions expose reading and writing operations for I/O ports or memory-mapped registers without revealing platform specifics.
- **Interrupt delivery**: The HAL is responsible for routing hardware interrupts to the kernel's dispatcher regardless of the underlying controller design.
- **Timing services**: A consistent timebase API allows schedulers and drivers to measure delays and schedule timeouts.

By encapsulating these tasks, the HAL enables LifeOS to run on different architectures with minimal changes outside of the HAL implementation itself.

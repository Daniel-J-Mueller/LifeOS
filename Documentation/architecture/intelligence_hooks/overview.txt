Integration Hooks for External Intelligence Frameworks
======================================================

LifeOS aims to support advanced reasoning or monitoring frameworks that run
outside of the core kernel.  To keep the kernel small and maintainable these
frameworks communicate through well defined hooks rather than direct
modification of kernel code.

Planned hook locations:

- **Boot sequence** – the kernel checks for a module or service at boot that can
  register callbacks for system events.
- **Console interface** – commands typed by the user can be forwarded to the
  external framework for processing or advice.
- **Scheduling policies** – future versions may allow an external component to
  influence task scheduling decisions by exposing a policy API.

Communication methods are intentionally simple to begin with.  A plain text
protocol over a virtual serial port or network interface keeps implementations
portable.  Initial prototypes will focus on passing console commands to a host
process running on the same machine.

These hooks allow experimentation with AI assistance without entangling the core
operating system logic.  As capabilities mature the interfaces can evolve while
keeping the kernel stable.

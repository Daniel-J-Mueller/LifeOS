Compute Inventory Service
========================

The compute inventory service collects details about the hardware
available at boot time. Other subsystems query this information to
adjust their behavior or load appropriate drivers.

CPU core counts are obtained through the HAL using the CPUID
instruction when available. Physical memory size is currently
retrieved from a HAL stub that returns a fixed value.

Data Structure
--------------

Inventory information is stored in a single `compute_inventory` struct:

```
struct compute_inventory {
    unsigned int cpu_cores;     /* number of detected CPU cores */
    unsigned long memory_bytes; /* total system memory in bytes */
};
```

Future revisions may extend this structure with bus data and storage
capacities. For now it captures only the most essential properties
required during early initialization.

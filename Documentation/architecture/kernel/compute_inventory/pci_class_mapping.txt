PCI Class Name Mapping
======================

The console `info` command translates raw PCI class codes into short
human-readable descriptions. This mapping currently covers the most
common classes defined by the PCI specification. Unknown codes are
reported as "Unknown".

The mapping is implemented in `src/kernel/inventory/pci_classes.c` and
exposed through `pci_class_name()`. The function returns one of the
following strings based on the class code value:

- 0x00: Unclassified
- 0x01: Mass Storage
- 0x02: Network
- 0x03: Display
- 0x04: Multimedia
- 0x05: Memory
- 0x06: Bridge
- 0x07: Communication
- 0x08: System
- 0x09: Input
- 0x0A: Docking
- 0x0B: Processor
- 0x0C: Serial Bus
- 0x0D: Wireless
- 0x0E: Intelligent I/O
- 0x0F: Satellite
- 0x10: Encryption
- 0x11: Signal Processing
- 0x12: Processing Accel
- 0x13: Instrumentation

PCI Bus Enumeration
===================

The compute inventory service performs a PCI scan across all buses (0–255).
It counts how many functions respond and records each device's class code.
Access to configuration space is provided through the HAL. The
implementation writes a 32‑bit address to port `0xCF8` and then reads the
resulting value from `0xCFC`.

For each possible device (0–31) and function (0–7) combination the
vendor ID field is read. If it is not `0xFFFF` the function is
considered present and contributes to the device count. When a device is
found the byte at offset `0x0B` of its configuration header is captured
as the class code and stored sequentially in `compute_inventory.pci_class`.
The scan is performed during early kernel initialization and the totals
are stored in the global inventory structure.

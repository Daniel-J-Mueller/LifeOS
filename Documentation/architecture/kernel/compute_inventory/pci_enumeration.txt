PCI Bus Enumeration
===================

The compute inventory service performs a PCI scan across all buses (0–255).
It counts how many functions respond and records each device's class code.
Access to configuration space is provided through the HAL. The
implementation writes a 32‑bit address to port `0xCF8` and then reads the
resulting value from `0xCFC`.

For each possible device (0–31) and function (0–7) combination the
vendor ID field is read. If it is not `0xFFFF` the function is
considered present and contributes to the device count. When a device is
found the bytes at offsets `0x0B` and `0x0A` of its configuration header are
captured as the class and subclass codes. The bus number where each device
resides is also stored. These values are saved sequentially in
`compute_inventory.pci_bus`, `compute_inventory.pci_class` and
`compute_inventory.pci_subclass`.
The scan is performed during early kernel initialization and the totals
are stored in the global inventory structure.

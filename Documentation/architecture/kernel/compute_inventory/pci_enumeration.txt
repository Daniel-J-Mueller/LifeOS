PCI Bus Enumeration
===================

The compute inventory service performs a very small PCI scan to count
how many devices exist on bus `0`. Access to configuration space is
provided through the HAL. The implementation writes a 32‑bit address to
port `0xCF8` and then reads the resulting value from `0xCFC`.

For each possible device (0–31) and function (0–7) combination the
vendor ID field is read. If it is not `0xFFFF` the function is
considered present and contributes to the device count. The scan is
performed during early kernel initialization and the total is stored in
`compute_inventory.pci_devices`.

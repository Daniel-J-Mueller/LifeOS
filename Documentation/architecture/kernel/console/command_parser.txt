Console Command Parser
======================

The command parser interprets lines entered at the console and invokes
built-in functions. Early revisions recognize three commands:

- `help`  – display a short list of supported commands.
- `clear` – clear the console screen.
- `info`  – print basic hardware information.

Parsing is case sensitive and whitespace at the start or end of the line is not
ignored. Unknown commands result in an "Unknown command" message. This parser is
intentionally minimal to keep early interaction simple while higher level
interfaces are developed.

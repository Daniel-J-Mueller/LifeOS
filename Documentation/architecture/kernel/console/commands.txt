Console Commands
================

The console currently supports a very small set of commands to assist
with early debugging. Commands are entered at a prompt and executed
immediately.

Supported commands:

- `help`  : Display a list of available commands.
- `clear` : Clear the screen of all text.

Additional commands will appear as the command parser and subsystems
evolve.

The console manages keyboard input using a simple ring buffer. Each call to
`console_poll_input()` queries the keyboard driver for a new character. If a
character is available it is stored in the buffer provided space remains.

Kernel components can retrieve typed characters using `console_getc()`. The
function returns `0` when the buffer is empty. Basic line editing is provided:
pressing backspace adds a control character to the buffer which higher layers
interpret to delete the preceding character. The left and right arrow keys move
the cursor within the current line so characters can be inserted or removed at
any position. More advanced editing will be handled by higher layers.

The kernel's idle task calls `console_poll_input()` on every loop
iteration to ensure keystrokes are collected even when no other tasks
are active.

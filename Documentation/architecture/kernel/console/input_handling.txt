The console manages keyboard input using a simple ring buffer. Each call to
`console_poll_input()` queries the keyboard driver for a new character. If a
character is available it is stored in the buffer provided space remains.

Kernel components can retrieve typed characters using `console_getc()`. The
function returns `0` when the buffer is empty. No line editing is performed at
this stage; higher layers are expected to build command processing on top of
these primitives.

The kernel's idle task calls `console_poll_input()` on every loop
iteration to ensure keystrokes are collected even when no other tasks
are active.

Interactive Shell
=================

The interactive shell reads characters gathered by the console input
handler and interprets complete lines using the command parser.

A dedicated shell task echoes characters to the screen while building
an input buffer. When the user presses enter, the buffer contents are
passed to `console_execute_command()`. Basic backspace editing is
supported and a simple prompt is displayed after each command. The
shell also remembers a small history of previously entered commands.
Pressing the up or down arrow keys cycles through this history so
commands can be repeated or edited without retyping them. Holding
**Ctrl** while pressing the up or down arrow scrolls the display
through the new scrollback buffer. Once scrolling has begun, the arrow
keys continue moving through previous output until the bottom of the
screen is reached.

Typing `exit` at the prompt halts LifeOS and returns control to the
emulator, allowing the virtual machine to be closed cleanly.

Issuing the `restart` command performs a full system reboot using the
kernel's power management interface.

The `shutdown` command powers the machine off via ACPI and is useful
when running under virtualization where a clean power off is required.

The shell task runs alongside other kernel tasks so input can be
processed while background activity occurs.

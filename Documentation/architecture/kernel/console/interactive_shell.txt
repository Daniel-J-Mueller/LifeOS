Interactive Shell
=================

The interactive shell reads characters gathered by the console input
handler and interprets complete lines using the command parser.

A dedicated shell task echoes characters to the screen while building
an input buffer. When the user presses enter, the buffer contents are
passed to `console_execute_command()`. Basic backspace editing is
supported and a simple prompt is displayed after each command.

The shell task runs alongside other kernel tasks so input can be
processed while background activity occurs.

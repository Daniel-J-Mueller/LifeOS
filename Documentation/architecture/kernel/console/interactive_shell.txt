Interactive Shell
=================

The interactive shell reads characters gathered by the console input
handler and interprets complete lines using the command parser.

A dedicated shell task echoes characters to the screen while building
an input buffer. When the user presses enter, the buffer contents are
passed to `console_execute_command()`. Basic backspace editing is
supported and a simple prompt is displayed after each command. The
shell also remembers a small history of previously entered commands.
Pressing the up or down arrow keys cycles through this history so
commands can be repeated or edited without retyping them.

Typing `exit` at the prompt halts LifeOS and returns control to the
emulator, allowing the virtual machine to be closed cleanly.

Issuing the `restart` command performs a full system reboot using the
kernel's power management interface.

The `shutdown` command powers the machine off via ACPI and is useful
when running under virtualization where a clean power off is required.

The shell task runs alongside other kernel tasks so input can be
processed while background activity occurs.

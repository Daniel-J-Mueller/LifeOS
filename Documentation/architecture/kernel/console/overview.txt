Console Interface
=================

The console provides simple text I/O using the VGA text mode buffer. It is
initialized during `kernel_init` and offers basic routines to write characters or
strings to the screen. Early versions support a single screen with automatic
cursor updates.

Input Handling
--------------

Keyboard input is queued in a small ring buffer managed by the console. The
function `console_poll_input()` checks the keyboard driver for typed characters
and stores them in the buffer. Characters can then be retrieved with
`console_getc()`, returning `0` when no input is available.

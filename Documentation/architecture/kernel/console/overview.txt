Console Interface
=================

The console provides simple text I/O using the VGA text mode buffer. It is
initialized during `kernel_init` and offers basic routines to write characters or
strings to the screen. Early versions support a single screen with automatic
cursor updates.

Input Handling
--------------

Keyboard input is queued in a small ring buffer managed by the console. The
function `console_poll_input()` checks the keyboard driver for typed characters
and stores them in the buffer. Characters can then be retrieved with
`console_getc()`, returning `0` when no input is available.

Command Parsing
---------------

Higher level components use `console_execute_command()` to interpret a line of
text. Only `help` and `clear` are recognized at this stage, keeping the parser
minimal while the shell is under development.

Interactive Shell
-----------------

The interactive shell runs in its own kernel task. It consumes characters
from the console input buffer, echoes them to the screen and executes
commands when the enter key is pressed. The shell currently supports basic
backspace editing and shows a simple `LifeOS>` prompt.

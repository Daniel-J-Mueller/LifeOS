Console Interface
=================

The console provides simple text I/O using the VGA text mode buffer. It is
initialized during `kernel_init` and now also configures the COM1 serial port so
all output appears on the host terminal. Basic routines write characters or
strings to both VGA and serial with automatic cursor updates on screen.

Input Handling
--------------

Keyboard input is queued in a small ring buffer managed by the console. The
function `console_poll_input()` checks the keyboard driver for typed characters
and stores them in the buffer. Characters can then be retrieved with
`console_getc()`, returning `0` when no input is available.

Command Parsing
---------------

Higher level components use `console_execute_command()` to interpret a line of
text. The parser currently accepts `help`, `clear` and `info`. The `info`
command now lists each PCI device with its bus number, vendor and device IDs,
and class name using short descriptive labels, while the
overall feature set remains minimal during early shell development.

Interactive Shell
-----------------

The interactive shell runs in its own kernel task. It consumes characters
from the console input buffer, echoes them to the screen and executes
commands when the enter key is pressed. The shell currently supports basic
backspace editing and shows a simple `LifeOS>` prompt.

The console now maintains a small scrollback buffer in memory. When
output reaches the bottom of the screen, the visible lines are shifted
up and the oldest line is preserved in this buffer. Up to one hundred
lines are kept so previous messages remain accessible.

Hold the **Ctrl** key and press the up or down arrow keys to browse the
scrollback history. Once scrolling has begun, the arrow keys alone
continue moving through the buffer. Any new output automatically returns
to the live view at the bottom.

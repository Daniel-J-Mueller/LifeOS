The VGA text buffer resides at physical address 0xB8000. Early revisions
of the console used a normal pointer to access this memory. Under certain
compiler optimizations the buffer contents were cached in registers which
caused the visible screen to blank shortly after boot when the data was
not immediately written back. The pointer is now declared `volatile` so
all writes go directly to the emulated hardware. This keeps text stable
when running under QEMU.

Keyboard Driver
===============

The keyboard driver implements a minimal PS/2 poller. During initialization it
simply registers itself with the driver model. `keyboard_read_char()` may be
polled by the console or other subsystems to obtain a typed character. The
current implementation translates a limited set of scancodes into ASCII and does
not handle modifier keys.

File System Initialization
=========================

The kernel calls `fs_init` early in `kernel_init` to prepare the in-memory
storage layer. The routine zeroes the static array of file descriptors so
subsystems can safely create and open files once the console and other
services are ready.

Future revisions may expand this step to mount persistent storage devices
and populate the file hierarchy.

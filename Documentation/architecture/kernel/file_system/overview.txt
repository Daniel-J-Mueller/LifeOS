Simple File System Layer
=======================

LifeOS now includes a minimal in-memory file system used for early
development and testing. The implementation keeps a fixed array of
files that are stored entirely in RAM. Each file is limited to 4 KiB of
contents and identified by a short name.

Design Goals
------------
- Provide a straightforward API so other subsystems can experiment with
  persistent objects before a real disk driver exists.
- Avoid dynamic memory requirements by using static buffers.
- Keep the interface small: create, open, read and write operations are
  supported.

Future work will extend this layer to handle directories, larger
storage and integration with the virtual memory system.

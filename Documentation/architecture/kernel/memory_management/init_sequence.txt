Memory Management Initialization
===============================

The early kernel calls `mm_init` during `kernel_init` to prepare the
memory manager. `mm_init` now sets the starting address for the physical
page allocator based on the end of the kernel image. Each call to
`page_alloc` returns a 4&nbsp;KiB page and advances this pointer.

Future revisions will create page tables and more robust allocation
structures so higher layers can request memory safely and free pages
when they are no longer needed.

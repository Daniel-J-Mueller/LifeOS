Physical Allocator
=================

The physical allocator maintains free pages of memory for the rest of the kernel. In the
initial implementation a very small "bump" allocator is used. Pages are handed
out sequentially starting just after the kernel image. Freeing pages is not yet
supported, but the interface will eventually evolve into a bitmap based manager
as described in future tasks.

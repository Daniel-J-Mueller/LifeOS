Kernel Overview
===============

The kernel coordinates all core services of LifeOS. Subdirectories describe its major components in detail:

- `memory_management` — allocates and maps system memory.
- `scheduler` — chooses which tasks execute and when.
- `driver_model` — standard interface for hardware drivers.

The C function `kmain` acts as the high-level entry point after the assembly
stub switches the processor to protected mode.

As new subsystems appear, they will be documented under this directory.

ACPI Parser Stub
================

The `acpi_init()` function now searches both the EBDA and BIOS memory
regions for the Root System Description Pointer (RSDP).  If a revision 2
pointer is discovered the XSDT is used, otherwise the older RSDT is
processed.  Each entry is enumerated and stored in an internal list so
additional tables can be queried later.  The Fixed ACPI Description
Table provides the PM1 control registers used for shutdown.  Should any
required table be missing the routine falls back to defaults compatible
with QEMU.  The `acpi_get_fadt()` accessor returns the parsed FADT while
`acpi_get_table()` allows lookups by signature.

The bootloader now maps the first gigabyte of physical memory so ACPI
tables located above the 2 MiB mark are accessible early in kernel
startup.  The parser accepts any table address below 0x40000000 and
prints the location and key fields for debugging over the serial
console.

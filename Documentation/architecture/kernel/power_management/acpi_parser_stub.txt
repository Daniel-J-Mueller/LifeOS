ACPI Parser Stub
================

The `acpi_init()` function scans for ACPI tables.  At this stage it is a
stub that announces itself through the console and fills a small
`acpi_fadt` structure with default values.  The power management code
uses these fields to determine which ports to program when shutting the
machine down.  The `acpi_get_fadt()` accessor exposes the pointer so
other modules can use the information once real parsing code is added.

ACPI Parser Stub
================

The `acpi_init()` function now searches the BIOS memory region for the
Root System Description Pointer (RSDP).  When found, it walks the RSDT
to locate the Fixed ACPI Description Table and copies the relevant port
addresses into the `acpi_fadt` structure.  If any table is missing the
routine falls back to a set of defaults compatible with QEMU.  The
`acpi_get_fadt()` accessor exposes the populated structure so other
subsystems can retrieve the power management register locations.

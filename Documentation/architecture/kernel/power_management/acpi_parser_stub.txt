ACPI Parser Stub
================

The `acpi_init()` function now searches both the EBDA and BIOS memory
regions for the Root System Description Pointer (RSDP).  If a revision 2
pointer is discovered the XSDT is used, otherwise the older RSDT is
processed.  Each entry is enumerated and stored in an internal list so
additional tables can be queried later.  The Fixed ACPI Description
Table provides the PM1 control registers used for shutdown.  Should any
required table be missing the routine falls back to defaults compatible
with QEMU.  The `acpi_get_fadt()` accessor returns the parsed FADT while
`acpi_get_table()` allows lookups by signature.

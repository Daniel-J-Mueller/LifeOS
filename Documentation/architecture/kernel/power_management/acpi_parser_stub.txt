ACPI Parser Stub
================

The `acpi_init()` function now searches the BIOS memory region for the
Root System Description Pointer (RSDP).  When found, it walks the RSDT
and records each referenced table pointer.  The Fixed ACPI Description
Table is parsed to populate an `acpi_fadt` structure containing the
power management register locations.  All discovered table headers are
stored in an internal list so additional tables can be queried later.
If any required table is missing the routine falls back to a set of
defaults compatible with QEMU.  The `acpi_get_fadt()` accessor returns
the parsed FADT while `acpi_get_table()` allows lookups by signature.

ACPI Parser Stub
================

The `acpi_init()` function scans for ACPI tables.  At this stage it is a
stub that only announces itself through the console.  A pointer to the
FADT is stored for future use by power management routines.  The
`acpi_get_fadt()` accessor returns this pointer so other kernel modules
can query it once real parsing code is added.

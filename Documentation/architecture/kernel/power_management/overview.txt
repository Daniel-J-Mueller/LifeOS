Power Management Overview
=========================

LifeOS provides simple interfaces to halt, reboot and power off the
machine.  While the current implementation writes directly to ACPI
power management registers, upcoming work will rely on parsed ACPI
tables to discover the proper shutdown mechanism.

The first step toward this is a minimal ACPI table parser stub.  The
parser is initialized during kernel startup and will eventually locate
the Fixed ACPI Description Table (FADT).  For now it simply prints an
initialization message and stores a NULL pointer.

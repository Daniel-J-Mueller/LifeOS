Power Management Overview
=========================

LifeOS provides simple interfaces to halt, reboot and power off the
machine.  Early versions wrote directly to well known ACPI power
management ports.  The implementation now relies on stubbed ACPI
tables to supply the register addresses used for shutdown.

The parser initializes during kernel startup and sets up a small
representation of the Fixed ACPI Description Table (FADT).  Default
values for QEMU are populated so the power code can pull the PM1
control ports and S5 sleep types.  Future work will locate the real
tables instead of these constants.

Power Management Overview
=========================

LifeOS provides simple interfaces to halt, reboot and power off the
machine.  Early versions wrote directly to well known ACPI power
management ports.  The implementation now relies on stubbed ACPI
tables to supply the register addresses used for shutdown.

The parser initializes during kernel startup, scanning memory for the
RSDP and enumerating every table listed in the RSDT.  The Fixed ACPI
Description Table is parsed to obtain the PM1 control registers and S5
sleep types.  All discovered table headers are kept in a small array so
other kernel subsystems may query them by signature.  Default values for
QEMU are still provided when enumeration fails so basic power management
continues to work.

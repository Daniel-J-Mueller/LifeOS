Shutdown via FADT
=================

With the stub ACPI parser in place, power off now relies on the
`acpi_fadt` structure.  The table contains the PM1 control port
addresses and sleep type values needed to request the S5 state.
`kernel_shutdown()` looks up these fields and writes the sleep command
to each port.  Default values targeting QEMU are provided until real
ACPI table parsing is implemented.

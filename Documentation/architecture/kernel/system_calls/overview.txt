System Call Interface
=====================

User tasks invoke kernel services through a small system call layer.  Early
versions route requests directly through a software interrupt handler.  A simple
dispatch routine interprets the system call number and arguments, then calls the
corresponding kernel implementation.

Initial Call Set
----------------

Two calls are currently defined:

* `SYS_CONSOLE_WRITE` — print a string to the console.
* `SYS_YIELD` — voluntarily yield the CPU to the scheduler.

Future revisions will expand this table and transition user tasks to run in a
separate privilege level.

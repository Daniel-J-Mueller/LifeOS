System Control
==============

The kernel provides a minimal interface for basic power management.
The `kernel_halt()` function disables interrupts and issues the `hlt`
instruction in a loop. It is used by the console `exit` command to stop
the virtual machine when running under QEMU.

`kernel_reboot()` issues a reset request through the keyboard controller
to reboot the machine. The console `restart` command exposes this
functionality to the user.

`kernel_shutdown()` writes to the ACPI power management registers to
power down the system.  An early stub ACPI parser initializes during
boot and will eventually supply the exact register addresses.  The
`shutdown` command in the interactive shell triggers this sequence.

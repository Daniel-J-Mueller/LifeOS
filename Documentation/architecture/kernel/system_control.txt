System Control
==============

The kernel provides a minimal interface for halting the operating system.
Currently this consists of the `kernel_halt()` function which disables
interrupts and issues the `hlt` instruction in a loop. It is used by the
console `exit` command to stop the virtual machine when running under QEMU.

Additional power management features such as reboot or sleep states may be
added in future revisions.

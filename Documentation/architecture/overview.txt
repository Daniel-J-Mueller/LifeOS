LifeOS Architecture Overview
============================

LifeOS is organized into modular components to simplify development and testing.
Major parts include:

- **Bootloader**: Initializes hardware state and loads the kernel.
- **Kernel**: Provides core services such as memory management, task scheduling,
  and device management.
- **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)**: Offers a consistent interface to
  underlying hardware devices.
- **Device Drivers**: Implement support for specific hardware peripherals.
- **Console Interface**: Minimal text interface for user interaction.
- **External Intelligence Hooks**: Integration points for advanced frameworks.

Each component will be developed incrementally with clear responsibilities and
interfaces.

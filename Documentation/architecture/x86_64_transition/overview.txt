LifeOS x86_64 Transition
=======================

LifeOS now boots a 64-bit kernel. Migrating to the new architecture required
enabling long mode in the bootloader and rewriting the early assembly stubs.
The remaining work will continue in stages:

1. **Bootloader upgrade** – extend the existing bootloader to enable long mode
   after loading the kernel. This requires building identity mapped page tables
   and updating the GDT for 64-bit code segments.
2. **Kernel entry rewrite** – provide a new assembly stub that switches from real
   mode to long mode before calling `kmain`.
3. **64-bit build scripts** – update `build_image.sh` to compile the kernel with
   `x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc` and link using `ld` for the `elf_x86_64` format.
4. **Source updates** – audit all assembly files for 32-bit instructions and
   convert them to their 64-bit equivalents.
5. **Testing** – once a minimal boot is functional, update unit tests and
   documentation to reflect the new architecture.

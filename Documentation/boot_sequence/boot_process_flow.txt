Boot Sequence Overview
======================

This document outlines the expected order of operations when LifeOS starts.
Key stages:

1. Firmware hands control to the bootloader.
2. Bootloader prepares the environment and loads the kernel.
3. Kernel sets up essential subsystems such as memory management and scheduler.
4. A compute inventory is gathered to understand available hardware and I/O.
5. Console and external interfaces are initialized.

Compute Inventory
=================

During initialization, the kernel queries connected hardware to build an
inventory of available compute resources and I/O capabilities. This includes
CPU features, memory size, storage devices, and peripheral interfaces.

The inventory guides configuration of drivers and system services, ensuring that
each component is aware of what resources exist and how best to utilize them.

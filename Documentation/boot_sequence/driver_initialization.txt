Driver Initialization Sequence
==============================

Once core memory management and the scheduler are ready, built-in device drivers
are registered. Each driver provides a small structure to the driver model which
records its name and an initialization callback. The driver model maintains a
list in the order that drivers register. During `kernel_init` the kernel calls
`driver_init_all()` which iterates over the list and invokes each driver's init
function in sequence.

This predictable ordering ensures that devices come online before higher level
subsystems rely on them.

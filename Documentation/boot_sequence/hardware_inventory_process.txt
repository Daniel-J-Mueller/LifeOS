Compute Inventory
=================

LifeOS relies on an early enumeration phase to learn what hardware is present. The kernel exposes a compute inventory service that performs the following steps:

1. **CPU and memory discovery**
   - Query the processor for feature flags, supported instruction sets, and core counts.
   - Measure available physical memory using firmware-provided tables or probing techniques.
2. **Bus scanning**
   - Enumerate devices on common buses such as PCI or platform-specific interconnects.
   - Record how many PCI devices respond to aid later driver loading.
3. **Storage and peripheral cataloging**
   - Detect block devices, input peripherals, and communication interfaces.
   - Record device capacities and any unique attributes required by the driver model.

All gathered information is stored in a structured table accessible by other subsystems. By centralizing discovery, the boot process remains consistent across platforms and the OS can adapt to differing hardware capabilities.

Bootloader Error Handling Strategy
=================================

The initial bootloader performs minimal checks while loading the kernel.
If a disk read fails or the kernel image is invalid, execution halts and
an error message is printed. Future revisions will extend this strategy
with retry attempts and more descriptive diagnostics to aid debugging.

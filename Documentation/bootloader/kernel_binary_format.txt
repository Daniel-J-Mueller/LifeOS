Kernel Binary Format
====================

The initial LifeOS kernel is built as a flat binary image so the bootloader can
load it with minimal logic. The image starts with 32‑bit code at the first byte
and contains no headers. Execution begins immediately at offset `0x0000` after
the image is loaded into memory.

Requirements for the image:

- Code must be position‑independent within the loaded memory range.
- The bootloader currently loads 16 sectors (8 KiB) starting at the second sector
  of the boot device to address `0x0000:0x1000` (physical `0x1000`).
- The kernel should not rely on being relocated and must set up its own protected
  mode environment after entry.

Future revisions may adopt a more complex executable format, but the flat image
keeps the bootstrap process simple while core subsystems come online.

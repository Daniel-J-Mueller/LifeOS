Kernel Binary Format
====================

The initial LifeOS kernel is built as a flat binary image so the bootloader can
load it with minimal logic. The image begins with 64‑bit code and contains no
headers. Execution begins immediately at offset `0x0000` after the image is
loaded into memory.

Requirements for the image:

- Code must be position‑independent within the loaded memory range.
 - The bootloader currently loads 32 sectors (16 KiB) starting at the second sector
    of the boot device to address `0x0000:0x1000` (physical `0x1000`).
 - The kernel should not rely on being relocated and must assume long mode is
    already active when control is transferred.

Future revisions may adopt a more complex executable format, but the flat image
keeps the bootstrap process simple while core subsystems come online.

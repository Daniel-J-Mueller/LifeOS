Bootloader Overview
===================

This directory describes the LifeOS bootloader and how it hands control to the kernel.

The bootloader is responsible for:
- Setting up a temporary execution environment after firmware handoff.
- Loading the kernel image from the boot device into memory.
- Passing execution to the kernel once the image has been verified and mapped.

The code for the bootloader resides under `src/boot` as a small assembly
program. It prints a loading message, reads the flat 64-bit kernel image from
disk using BIOS services, and then jumps to the loaded address. Error handling
is minimal at this stage and will be improved in later tasks.

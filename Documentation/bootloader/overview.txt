Bootloader Overview
===================

This directory describes the LifeOS bootloader and how it hands control to the kernel.

The bootloader is responsible for:
- Setting up a temporary execution environment after firmware handoff.
- Loading the kernel image from the boot device into memory.
- Passing execution to the kernel once the image has been verified and mapped.

The code for the bootloader resides under `src/boot` and is currently a single
assembly file that prints a loading message and loops. Loading logic will be
implemented in future tasks.

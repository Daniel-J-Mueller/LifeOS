Building and Running LifeOS
===========================

This document describes how to compile the kernel and launch it under QEMU.
It assumes the cross compiler and emulator have been installed with
`scripts/setup_toolchain.sh`.

1. **Build the kernel**
   Navigate to the repository root and run:
   ```
   gcc -m32 -ffreestanding -c src/kernel/main.c -o build/main.o
   # Additional objects would be compiled here
   ld -melf_i386 -T src/kernel/linker.ld build/main.o -o build/kernel.bin
   ```
   These commands produce a minimal kernel binary at `build/kernel.bin`.

2. **Run in QEMU**
   Launch the kernel with:
   ```
   qemu-system-x86_64 -kernel build/kernel.bin -serial stdio
   ```
   QEMU will start the virtual machine and display console output in the
   terminal window.

A proper build system will replace these manual commands in future revisions.

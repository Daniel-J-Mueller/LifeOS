Building and Running LifeOS
===========================

This document describes how to compile the operating system and launch it under
QEMU.  It assumes the cross compiler and emulator have been installed with
`sudo ./scripts/setup_toolchain.sh`.

1. **Build the bootable image**
   From the repository root run:
   ```
   ./scripts/build_image.sh
   ```
   The script compiles the kernel sources, calculates how many disk
   sectors the kernel occupies and assembles the bootloader with that
   value. The resulting `build/os-image.bin` contains both components.

2. **Run in QEMU**
   Launch the image with:
   ```
   qemu-system-x86_64 -drive format=raw,file=build/os-image.bin \
     -serial mon:stdio -enable-kvm
   ```
   The `-enable-kvm` option uses hardware virtualization when available
   for improved performance.
   By default QEMU opens a graphical window that mirrors the VGA text
   buffer. If your environment lacks a display server, specify a
   different output method:
   ```
   qemu-system-x86_64 -drive format=raw,file=build/os-image.bin \
     -serial mon:stdio -display curses -enable-kvm
   ```
   This keeps the console visible in the terminal. Use `Ctrl+A X` to exit
   when running in `-nographic` or `-display curses` modes.

These commands provide a simple workflow on Ubuntu for testing the current
LifeOS prototype. A more sophisticated build system may replace the script in
future revisions.

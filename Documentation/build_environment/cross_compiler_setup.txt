Cross Compiler Setup
====================

LifeOS uses cross-compilation to produce binaries for multiple targets. The `scripts/setup_toolchain.sh` helper installs a minimal set of packages for building 32-bit and 64-bit x86 images.

Run the following from the repository root:

```
sudo ./scripts/setup_toolchain.sh
```

After installation the `i686-linux-gnu` and `x86_64-linux-gnu` GCC toolchains are ready for use.

Cross Compiler Setup
====================

LifeOS uses cross-compilation to produce binaries for multiple targets. The
`scripts/setup_toolchain.sh` helper installs a minimal set of packages for
building 64-bit x86 images. Earlier revisions attempted to install the 32-bit
toolchain as well, but the additional `i386` dependencies caused failures on
many systems. The script now installs only the `amd64` cross compiler by
default. Some distributions treat the cross packages as virtual and resolve
them to version-specific names. To maintain compatibility the script first tries
the `:amd64` variants and falls back to the default package names when
necessary.

Run the following from the repository root:

```
sudo ./scripts/setup_toolchain.sh
```

After installation the `x86_64-linux-gnu` GCC toolchain is ready for use.

Cross Compiler Setup
====================

LifeOS uses cross-compilation to produce binaries for multiple targets. The
`scripts/setup_toolchain.sh` helper installs a minimal set of packages for
building 32-bit and 64-bit x86 images. Some systems with multiarch enabled may
attempt to pull in `i386` variants of the cross packages which lack the required
libraries. The script prefers the native `amd64` packages and falls back to the
default names when necessary so the setup works across different Ubuntu
releases.

Run the following from the repository root:

```
sudo ./scripts/setup_toolchain.sh
```

After installation the `i686-linux-gnu` and `x86_64-linux-gnu` GCC toolchains are ready for use.

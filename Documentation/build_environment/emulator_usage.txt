Emulator Usage
==============

LifeOS uses QEMU to run and debug early kernels. Once the toolchain is installed, QEMU can launch the operating system image with a command like:

```
qemu-system-x86_64 -kernel path/to/kernel.bin -serial mon:stdio
```

Replace `path/to/kernel.bin` with the kernel binary produced by the build system. Additional devices or debugging options can be added as needed.

Managing QEMU Graphics on Multi-GPU Hosts
========================================

Systems with several GPUs may dedicate only one device to actual display
outputs while others are compute-only. QEMU renders the guest console
through the host's windowing system, so a missing or misconfigured
display server often presents as a blank window or no window at all.

Common fixes:

1. **Use the active X session**
   Ensure `DISPLAY` points to the X11 or Wayland session running on the
graphics card with connected monitors. For example:
   ```
   DISPLAY=:0 qemu-system-x86_64 -drive format=raw,file=build/os-image.bin -serial mon:stdio
   ```
   The window should appear on the GPU driving `:0`.

2. **Select a QEMU front-end**
   QEMU supports several interfaces with `-display`:
   - `-display gtk` (default GUI window)
   - `-display sdl` (SDL window)
   - `-display curses` for terminal-only output when no GUI is available

   Choose one that matches your environment. `curses` is handy for
   headless servers.

3. **Remote access**
   If no GPU provides local outputs, forward the display using VNC or
   SPICE:
   ```
   qemu-system-x86_64 -drive format=raw,file=build/os-image.bin -display vnc=0.0.0.0:0 -serial mon:stdio
   ```
   Connect a VNC client to view the console from another machine.

Properly directing QEMU's GUI resolves most graphics issues when the
host contains multiple GPUs.

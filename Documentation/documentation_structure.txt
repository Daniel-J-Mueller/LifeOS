This directory houses the design and implementation documents for LifeOS.
Each subdirectory describes a major component or system of the operating system.

Top-level sections include:
- `architecture` – overall design and subsystem breakdowns.
- `boot_sequence` – steps executed when LifeOS starts.
- `build_environment` – how to install toolchains and run the emulator.

Subdirectories may contain deeper folders to document specific subsystems in greater detail.

Dynamic Pane Manager
====================

LifeOS is moving toward a more flexible text interface using a grid of
"panes".  The screen initially starts as a single square.  Function keys
allow the operator to adjust the grid dimensions at run time:

* **F2** – increase the number of pane columns.
* **F1** – decrease the number of pane columns.
* **F4** – increase the number of pane rows.
* **F3** – decrease the number of pane rows.

The right **Alt** key moves the active pane to the left.  The **Fn** key
located to the right of the space bar moves the active pane to the right.
Pressing **Ctrl** together with these keys moves the active pane up and
down respectively.

When a pane becomes active it expands to roughly half of the display
area.  Remaining panes share the leftover space so the entire screen is
always filled.  For now only simple ASCII grid lines are drawn, but the
interface lays the groundwork for a future graphical window manager.

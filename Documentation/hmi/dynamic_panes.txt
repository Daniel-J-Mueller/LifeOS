Dynamic Pane Manager
====================

LifeOS is moving toward a more flexible text interface using a grid of
"panes".  The screen initially starts as a single square with the shell
prompt located at the bottom so output scrolls upward like a traditional
terminal.  Function keys
allow the operator to adjust the grid dimensions at run time:

* **F2** – increase the number of pane columns.
* **F1** – decrease the number of pane columns.
* **F4** – increase the number of pane rows.
* **F3** – decrease the number of pane rows.
* **F5** – move focus left.
* **F6** – move focus right.
* **F7** – move focus up.
* **F8** – move focus down.

The right **Alt** key still moves the active pane to the left and the
**Fn** key located to the right of the space bar moves it to the right.
Pressing **Ctrl** together with these keys moves the active pane up and
down respectively.  The dedicated function keys provide the same
behavior without any modifier keys.

The shell also exposes text commands that mirror these actions:

```
wider    - add a column
thinner  - remove a column
taller   - add a row
shorter  - remove a row
left     - move focus left
right    - move focus right
up       - move focus up
down     - move focus down
```

When a pane becomes active it expands to roughly half of the display
area.  Remaining panes share the leftover space so the entire screen is
always filled.  Earlier revisions used plain ASCII characters for the
grid.  The layout now draws box line characters from code page 437 so the
dividers appear as real lines.  After any resize or focus change the
command prompt is redisplayed in the active pane.

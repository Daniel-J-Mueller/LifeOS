HMI Expectations
================

Early revisions of LifeOS rely on a simple text console for all
interaction. Input is gathered from a keyboard device while output
is written to the VGA text buffer. The user can expect the following
capabilities:

- Visible boot messages during system startup.
- A console prompt ready to accept simple commands.
- Previous commands can be recalled using the up/down arrow keys.
- The left and right arrow keys move the cursor for basic in-line editing.
- Minimal visual clutter with focus on status information.
- Typing `gui start` enters a quadrant layout for future widgets.

As additional devices and graphical interfaces are introduced,
this document will expand to cover their behavior and configuration.

Human Machine Interface (HMI)
============================

LifeOS interacts with users primarily through text-based consoles.
The HMI layer describes input devices, output displays, and how
higher level components present information to human operators.

Planned Design
--------------

Once the OS finishes booting, a small terminal strip will remain
visible along the bottom of the screen. Users can speak commands or
type into this area to interact with the system. The rest of the
display is reserved for task oriented graphics that visualize ongoing
processing. This layout avoids a traditional command-based terminal
while still providing convenient textual interaction when needed.

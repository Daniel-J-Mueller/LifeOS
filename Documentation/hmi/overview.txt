Human Machine Interface (HMI)
============================

LifeOS interacts with users primarily through text-based consoles.
The HMI layer describes input devices, output displays, and how
higher level components present information to human operators.

Planned Design
--------------

After boot the screen is divided into four quadrants with simple
text lines. The console occupies the lower left section and retains
full command functionality. Other areas are currently unused but give
a foundation for future status widgets. This lightweight layout
avoids a traditional window manager while still providing room for
graphical output.

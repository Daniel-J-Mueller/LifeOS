Human Machine Interface (HMI)
============================

LifeOS interacts with users primarily through text-based consoles.
The HMI layer describes input devices, output displays, and how
higher level components present information to human operators.

Planned Design
--------------

LifeOS boots directly to a full screen terminal. The operator can
type `gui start` at the prompt to redraw the display into a four
quadrant layout. The console remains in the lower left quadrant while
the other sections provide space for future widgets. This lightweight
interface avoids a traditional window manager yet still reserves room
for graphical output.

Quadrant GUI Layout
===================

After issuing the `gui start` command the text screen divides into
four quadrants. A vertical and a horizontal line intersect at the
center to provide a simple grid using line drawing characters. The
bottom left quadrant hosts the console interface. After initialisation
the cursor is placed here and commands such as `help`, `info` and
`clear` operate as before. Other quadrants are reserved for future
status displays.

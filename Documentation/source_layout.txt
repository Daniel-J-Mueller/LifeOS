Source Code Layout
==================

LifeOS source code resides under the `src` directory. The layout mirrors the
major components documented in the architecture breakdown so development can
scale as features are added.

Current top-level directories include:
- `boot`   – Bootloader source that prepares the system and loads the kernel.
- `kernel` – Core kernel code. Subdirectories will house memory management,
             scheduler, and other subsystems.
- `hal`    – Hardware abstraction layer implementations.
- `drivers`– Device driver code.

Additional directories can be added as new subsystems are introduced. This
structure keeps the tree organized without being overly complex at the early
stages of the project.

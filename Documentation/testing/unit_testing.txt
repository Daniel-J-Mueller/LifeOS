Unit Testing Overview
=====================

This directory documents the small test programs used to validate isolated
components of LifeOS. Each test links against the OS sources with stubbed
hardware interfaces so logic can run on a standard host system.

The first available test verifies the compute inventory service:

- `tests/inventory_test.c` builds the inventory module with stub HAL
  functions and asserts that detected values match the expected stubs.

To build and run the test:

```
$ gcc -I src -DINVENTORY_TEST tests/inventory_test.c \
      src/kernel/inventory/inventory.c src/kernel/inventory/pci_classes.c -o tests/inventory_test
$ ./tests/inventory_test
```

Successful execution prints no output and returns zero.

To validate the ACPI parser stub and table discovery:

```
$ gcc -I src -DACPI_TEST tests/acpi_test.c src/kernel/acpi/acpi.c -o tests/acpi_test
$ ./tests/acpi_test
```

The test verifies that the parser populates the FADT structure and that
`acpi_get_table()` can locate the FADT by its signature.  Successful
execution prints no output and returns zero.
